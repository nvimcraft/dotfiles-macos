# Troubleshooting Flows

A flow is broken when it fails to move data correctly. This skill covers systematic diagnosis: identifying the problem type, isolating the failing step, inspecting errors, and resolving them.

Troubleshooting concerns:

- **Job status** -- understanding what `completed`, `failed`, `canceled`, and `retrying` mean for the flow
- **Error analysis** -- grouping errors by pattern to find root causes instead of reading them one-by-one
- **Request/response inspection** -- seeing exactly what was sent and returned at each step
- **Execution logs** -- record-level tracing through every stage of the pipeline
- **Retry and resolution** -- fixing error data and retrying vs bulk resolving
- **Delta/state issues** -- `lastExportDateTime` drift, stuck deltas, re-processing windows

## Problem Categories

### Total Failure

Job status is `failed` with 0 successful records. The entire run collapsed before processing any data. Typically `numPagesGenerated: 0` (export-level failure) or pages generated but `numPagesProcessed: 0` (import-level failure on the first page).

Common causes: connection failure (credentials expired, endpoint down), export query error (invalid SQL, bad saved search ID), missing/deleted resource, permission denied.

### Partial Failure

Job status is `completed` but `numError > 0` alongside successful records. Some records failed while others processed normally. Real-world data shows wide variance -- from 2 errors in 8000 successes to 500+ errors in 8000 successes.

Common causes: validation errors on the destination (required fields missing, type mismatches), duplicate key violations, record-level lookup failures, rate limiting on specific batches, data-dependent issues (specific records have bad data).

### Empty Run

Job completes successfully with 0 errors AND 0 records processed.

Common causes: wrong `resourcePath` on the export (extracts from wrong JSON path), delta export with no changes since last run (legitimate), output filter too restrictive (all records filtered out), source query returns no results, webhook export with no inbound events.

### Stuck or Long-Running

Job stays in `running` or `retrying` status longer than expected.

Common causes: large dataset with no pagination limits, destination system slow to respond, script hook with long-running logic, on-premise agent connectivity issues, rate limiting causing backoff.

### Intermittent Failures

Flow sometimes succeeds and sometimes fails with the same configuration.

Common causes: token/session expiry mid-run (long-running flows), rate limiting (varies with concurrent flows), transient network errors, source system maintenance windows.

## Error Diagnosis Framework

### Classification

When an error occurs, classify it into one of three categories to determine the right action:

| Category | HTTP status codes | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Needs investigation** | 400, 401, 403, 404, 405, 409, 422 | Missing info, wrong IDs, permission denied, validation errors | Stop and investigate -- check resource config, connection status, permissions |
| **Transient** | 408, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504 | Timeouts, rate limits, server errors | Retry once. If it fails again, escalate -- the external system may be down |
| **Configuration error** | varies | Preconditions not met but fixable | Follow the error message guidance to fix the config, then retry |

A 5xx error not in the transient list (e.g., 501) is still likely transient. A 4xx error not in the investigation list warrants manual review.

### Root Cause: Configuration vs Data

Every flow error has one of two root causes:

- **Static configuration** -- a hardcoded value in the step config is wrong (mapping expression, filter rule, hardcoded field, URI, query, SQL statement). Fix: change the resource configuration via `celigo <type> set`
- **Dynamic data** -- the upstream source sent unexpected data (missing required field, wrong type, null where a value is expected, unexpected array/object shape). Fix: add input filtering or validation upstream, or fix the source system

**To distinguish:** check if the error reproduces with different input records. If the same error occurs for every record, it's configuration. If only some records fail, it's data.

```bash
# Check if all records fail (configuration) or only some (data)
celigo flows error-summary <flowId>              # Compare error count vs total records
celigo flows errors <flowId> <stepId>            # Sample specific errors to compare
```

### Which Step Failed?

Error location determines which resource and skill to investigate:

| Error location | Resource to check | Skill |
|---|---|---|
| Export / page generator | Export config (connection, query, resourcePath) | configuring-exports |
| Import / page processor | Import config (mapping, destination fields, operation) | configuring-imports |
| Script hook | Script code (preSavePage, preMap, postMap, postSubmit) | writing-scripts |
| Mapping | Mapping expression (field paths, lookups, hardcoded values) | writing-mappings |
| Filter | Filter expression (s-expression syntax, field references) | configuring-filters |
| Connection | Connection config (auth, URL, credentials) | configuring-connections |

## Quick Reference

### Symptom --> First Command

| Symptom | Run first | Then |
|---|---|---|
| Flow totally failed | `celigo jobs latest-flow <flowId>` | Check `numPagesGenerated` -- if 0, export failed; check connection and query |
| Partial errors | `celigo flows error-summary <flowId>` | `celigo flows error-analyze <flowId> <stepId>` to find root cause pattern |
| Empty run (0 records) | `celigo jobs latest-flow <flowId>` | Check export config (`resourcePath`, delta state, output filter) |
| Stuck / long-running | `celigo jobs current --flow <flowId>` | Check job status; if `retrying`, inspect rate limiting or connection issues |
| Intermittent failures | `celigo jobs run-stats --flow <flowId>` | Compare failing vs passing runs; check token expiry and rate limits |

## Diagnostic Workflow

### 1. Check the job status

Start with the most recent job to understand what happened.

```bash
celigo jobs latest-flow <flowId>
celigo jobs get <jobId>
celigo jobs current --flow <flowId>
```

Key fields: `status`, `numError`, `numSuccess`, `numIgnore`, `numPagesGenerated`, `numPagesProcessed`, `startedAt`, `endedAt`. A `failed` status with `numPagesGenerated: 0` means the export itself failed -- don't look at import errors. `completed` with `numError > 0` means partial failure at the record level.

### 2. Get the error summary

See which steps have errors and how many.

```bash
celigo flows error-summary <flowId>
```

This returns per-step error counts. Focus on the step with the most errors first.

### 3. Analyze error patterns

Group errors by message pattern to find the root cause instead of reading them one-by-one.

```bash
celigo flows error-analyze <flowId> <exportOrImportId> [--limit 200]
```

If most errors share the same message, that's your root cause. Multiple distinct patterns may indicate multiple issues.

### 4. Inspect individual errors

Once you know the pattern, look at specific records and the HTTP request/response that produced the error.

```bash
celigo flows errors <flowId> <exportOrImportId>
celigo flows error-data <flowId> <exportOrImportId> <retryDataKey>
celigo flows error-request-detail <flowId> <exportOrImportId> <reqAndResKey>
```

`error-request-detail` is the most powerful diagnostic -- it shows exactly what HTTP request was sent and what the destination responded with.

### 5. Enable debug logging (if needed)

When errors don't tell the full story, enable execution logs for record-level tracing.

```bash
# Enable, run, then fetch logs
celigo flows execution-logs-enable <flowId> [--duration <minutes>]
celigo flows run <flowId> -y
celigo flows execution-logs <flowId> <jobId>

# Drill into a specific record's journey
celigo flows execution-log-data <flowId> <jobId> \
  --export-or-import-id <id> --stage <stage> \
  --group-id <gid> --record-id <rid>

# Always disable when done
celigo flows execution-logs-disable <flowId>
```

For HTTP-level debugging on a specific export or import:

```bash
celigo flows debug-requests <flowId> <exportOrImportId> [--since 60]
celigo flows debug-request-detail <flowId> <exportOrImportId> <key>
```

### 6. Use test runs for safe iteration

Test runs process a single page without affecting production data or delta state.

```bash
celigo flows test-run <flowId> --export <exportId>
celigo flows test-run-step <flowId> <runId> <exportOrImportId>
celigo flows test-run-step-logs <flowId> <runId> <exportOrImportId>
```

Test runs don't advance the delta timestamp -- you can repeat them safely against the same data.

### 7. Fix and retry (or resolve)

**Fix the configuration**, then retry:

```bash
celigo flows retry-errors <flowId> <exportOrImportId> -y
celigo flows retry-errors <flowId> <exportOrImportId> key1,key2,key3
```

**Fix the data** when specific records have bad values:

```bash
celigo flows error-data <flowId> <exportOrImportId> <retryDataKey>
# Edit the data, then:
celigo flows update-error-data <flowId> <exportOrImportId> <retryDataKey>
celigo flows retry-errors <flowId> <exportOrImportId> <retryDataKey>
```

**Resolve without retry** when errors are expected or not worth reprocessing:

```bash
celigo flows resolve-errors <flowId> <exportOrImportId> errorId1,errorId2
celigo flows resolve-errors <flowId> <exportOrImportId> -y
```

### 8. Verify the fix

Run the flow again and confirm clean execution.

```bash
celigo flows run <flowId> -y
celigo jobs latest-flow <flowId>
celigo flows error-summary <flowId>
```

## Diagnostic Checklist

Before escalating or concluding investigation:

- [ ] Checked job status via `celigo jobs latest-flow` -- confirmed `status`, `numError`, `numSuccess`, `numPagesGenerated`
- [ ] Ran `celigo flows error-summary` to identify which step(s) have errors
- [ ] Ran `celigo flows error-analyze` to group errors by pattern and identify root cause
- [ ] Inspected individual errors via `celigo flows errors` and `celigo flows error-data`
- [ ] Reviewed raw HTTP request/response via `celigo flows error-request-detail`
- [ ] If errors are unclear: enabled execution logs, re-ran flow, and inspected record-level trace
- [ ] If HTTP-level detail needed: used `celigo flows debug-requests` on the failing export/import
- [ ] Verified fix by re-running the flow and confirming clean execution

## Gotchas

1. **A `completed` job can still have errors.** `completed` means the job finished, not that every record succeeded. Always check `numError` alongside status.
2. **`error-analyze` only samples up to `--limit` errors.** Default is 100. For flows with thousands of errors, increase the limit to get an accurate pattern distribution.
3. **`error-request-detail` requires `reqAndResKey`, not `retryDataKey`.** These are different identifiers on the error record.
4. **Debug execution logs auto-disable after `--duration` minutes.** Default is 60. If your flow runs after the window expires, you get no logs. Enable, then run promptly.
5. **Test runs don't advance delta state.** This is intentional -- you can test repeatedly with the same data. But it means test runs always re-fetch the same records.
6. **Retrying resolved errors is not possible.** Once resolved, an error cannot be retried. Only resolve errors you're certain don't need reprocessing.
7. **`lastExportDateTime` drift causes re-processing or gaps.** If a delta export's timestamp is wrong, use `flows run --start-date` to override and reprocess a specific window.
8. **Empty `numPagesGenerated: 0` on a failed job means the export itself failed.** The problem is the source step -- check the connection, query, or endpoint, not the import.
9. **Execution log data is ephemeral.** Logs are retained for a limited time. Enable logging and run the flow promptly.
10. **`jobs diagnostics` produces a diagnostic bundle.** Use this when Celigo support asks for details -- it includes internal execution context not visible through other commands.

## Common Errors

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Diagnostic Steps |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| `failed` with `numPagesGenerated: 0` | Export-level failure (connection, query, endpoint) | Check connection status (`celigo connections ping`); review export config |
| `completed` with high `numError` | Destination validation or data issues | `error-analyze` to find pattern; `error-request-detail` for HTTP detail |
| `completed` with 0 records, 0 errors | Wrong `resourcePath`, empty delta, or filter too restrictive | Verify `resourcePath`; check `lastExportDateTime`; review output filter |
| `retrying` for extended period | Rate limiting, slow destination, or large dataset | Check destination rate limits; review concurrency on connection |
| Errors only on specific records | Data-dependent issue (missing fields, bad types, duplicates) | `error-data` to inspect failing records; compare with successful records |
| Intermittent `failed` on same flow | Token expiry mid-run, transient network, or rate limits | Compare timestamps of failures; check connection token refresh config |
| 401/403 errors in `error-request-detail` | Expired credentials or insufficient permissions | `celigo connections ping`; re-authorize if OAuth; check API permissions |
| Timeout errors | Slow destination or oversized payload | Reduce batch size; check destination system performance |
